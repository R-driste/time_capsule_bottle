A chrome extension for you to conveniently track your study time. I noticed that there weren't any robust
pomodoro web extensions in my search results so I decided to make one myself.

Need to study but don't have a candle or ice on hand? With our extension, you can easily open up the pop-up for convenient, aesthetic, and focused study time.

I have always used items as a means to control my study, ranging from hour-glasses to ice cubes to candles. Cubes and candles, two of my favorites, are the primary items that you can
interact with in my browser extension. I hope this app can bring a little more joy to someones study day.
