There are two ways to interact with the project. Because it is still pending for approval as an official chrome extension, you may:

### A. Check out the website version hosted on Vercel! The formatting is not as nice since the application is intended for a small popup window but the functionality is all the same :D
# Website Links:
## FOR PHONE [https://time-capsule-bottle.vercel.app/laptop] (recommended)
## FOR LAPTOP [https://time-capsule-bottle.vercel.app/laptop] (not recommended)

### B. To use this extension, simply download the extension zip, expand it, and click on manage extensions. Enable developer mode and connect the expanded folder. Voila, your extension should be available on your desktop.

Need to study but don't have ice or candles on hand? With our extension, you can easily open up the pop-up for convenient, aesthetic, and focused study time. Watch the ice slowly melt as the seconds tick away. Play some music tracks to go along and write down your goals. Later reference, your previous study goals as a means to feel accomplished :D. I have always used items as a means to control my study, ranging from hour-glasses to ice cubes to candles. Cubes and candles, two of my favorites, are the primary items that you can interact with in my browser extension. I noticed that there weren't any very robust pomodoro web extensions in my search results so I decided to make one myself. I hope this app can bring a little more joy to someones study day.
