# My Study Timer
A chrome extension for you to conveniently track your study time.

Need to study but don't have a glass of ice on hand? With our extension, you can easily open up the pop-up for convenient, aesthetic, and focused study time. Watch the ice slowly melt as the seconds tick away. Play some music tracks to go along and write down your goals. Later reference, your previous study goals as a means to feel accomplished :D.

I have always used items as a means to control my study, ranging from hour-glasses to ice cubes to candles. Cubes and candles, two of my favorites, are the primary items that you can interact with in my browser extension. I noticed that there weren't any very robust pomodoro web extensions in my search results so I decided to make one myself. I hope this app can bring a little more joy to someones study day.
