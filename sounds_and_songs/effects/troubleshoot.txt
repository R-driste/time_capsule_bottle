Hello!

I am ging to type in this document for several minutes to troubleshoot my wakatime because it is not updating my hours to the hackatime dashboard.
Why is my sister listening to Meovv without my guidance lol?

Anyways I need to work on the items feature, and I need to add an animated candle for the options
Then, I will be able to work well.
Lets see if the thing updated at all?

It did not work so now I have no choice but to troubleshoot withoutone more minute of senseless typing
because i lost an hours of coding time thanks to wakatime getting disconnected :( tragic.
I love hack club and i wish that hack club could be a little better at trouble shooting their
associated softwares so that students can perform better without having to do so much troubleshooting.
